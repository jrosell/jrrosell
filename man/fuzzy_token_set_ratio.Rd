\title{Fuzzy Token Set Ratio}
\usage{
fuzzy_token_set_ratio(s1, s2, score_cutoff = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{s1}{A character string. The first string to compare.}

\item{s2}{A character string. The second string to compare.}

\item{score_cutoff}{A numeric value (default is \code{0}) specifying the minimum similarity score threshold.
Scores below this threshold may trigger early exits in the computation.}
}
\value{
A numeric similarity score between \code{0} and \code{100}, representing the degree of similarity between the two input strings.
}
\description{
This function computes a fuzzy similarity score between two strings based on
the token set ratio methodology. It considers the intersection and
differences between tokenized word sets from the input strings, and
calculates a similarity score normalized by string lengths.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Tokenizes the input strings.
\item Identifies intersecting and differing tokens between the two tokenized sets.
\item Computes the longest common subsequence (LCS) distance for differing tokens and normalizes it.
\item Calculates similarity ratios for intersecting tokens combined with differing token sets.
\item Returns the maximum of the normalized LCS distance and the two intersecting token ratios.
}

The function short-circuits to return \code{100} if one token set is a subset of the other. If either input string is empty, the function returns \code{0}.

\examples{
# Example usage:
fuzzy_token_set_ratio("fuzzy was a bear", "fuzzy was a dog", score_cutoff = 80)
fuzzy_token_set_ratio("hello world", "world hello")
